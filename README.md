# Language Model Text Analysis with Burstiness and Perplexity

Welcome to the Language Model Text Analysis project, a tool designed to delve deep into textual data and unveil insights that lie beneath the surface. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques, including perplexity analysis and burstiness scoring, to assess and analyze text data.

## Overview

This application is built on the Streamlit framework, a user-friendly Python library for creating web applications. It employs the powerful NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to perform various text analysis tasks. Here's what you can achieve with this tool:

- **Perplexity Analysis**: Discover the complexity of a given text by calculating its perplexity score. Perplexity is a measure of how well a language model predicts a given text, helping to identify potentially generated or artificial content.

- **Burstiness Scoring**: Evaluate the burstiness of a text by assessing the variance in word frequency. Burstiness can hint at the presence of significant, contextually driven deviations in the text.

- **Visual Insights**: Visualize text analysis results with interactive charts, including the most common words and repeated words in the text.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**: Simply paste or type the text you want to analyze into the provided text area.

2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the text analysis process.

3. **Interpret Results**: After analysis, the tool presents insights such as the perplexity score and burstiness score, offering a clear understanding of the text's characteristics.

4. **Visualize Data**: Explore the graphical representations of the most common words and repeated words, providing additional context to the text's properties.

## Determining Generated Text

One of the unique aspects of this tool is its ability to indicate whether the input text is likely generated by a language model. If the perplexity score is low and the burstiness score is minimal, it suggests that the text may be machine-generated.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Streamlit and NLTK installed. You can tailor the language model to your specific requirements by choosing a different corpus for training. In this example, we've used the Brown Corpus for simplicity.

## Contribute and Enhance

This project is open to contributions and enhancements. Feel free to adapt it for your specific needs, integrate more advanced language models, or expand its capabilities.
